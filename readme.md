# Features:



- A modern design layout portfolio website with three column structure
- The styling is achieved using an external CSS. 
- Added images & hover effects for a great UI/UX experience
- Built with pure HTML5 & CSS3
- Made a responsive website to support mobile devices and tablets (iPad). 
- Contact section featuring email and phone options. 
- Used hover effect for certificates image gallery
- <figcaption> tag is used to give caption in certification section figures.
- The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area. I have used overflow: hidden in the assignemnt

## Below are the major HTML5 tags that have been used in designing the portfolio: 

**nav tag :** The <nav> tag defines a set of navigation links. The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links. I have used it as part of my header link

**ul tag:** It defines the unordered list, used as part of nav bar

**li tag:** list item  defines an individual list item within a list. Each list item usually rendered with a bullet (in unordered lists, defined by the <ul> tag) or a number or letter

**span tag:** It is used for grouping the inline elements,.The <span> tag is used for specifying a section in a document.

**fig tag:** The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element. The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or last child of the <figure> element.

**footer tag:** The <footer> tag defines a footer for a document or section. This contains links to my social media profiles. 

**section tag:** the entire index file is segregated through sections tag for easy access. 


**Creative Features: I have used keyframes to give some animation to the portfolio.**
